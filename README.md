## Homework Description

In this assignment we used the Bootstrap framework to create a columns and rows off data. We then used moment js to keep track of time and apply it to our day planner by dynamically changing the colors of hte text area base on the time of day. We also took the data written in the day planner and stored it in local storage so that the user can return to it even if they closed out of the tab.
